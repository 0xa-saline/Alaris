== Alaris

Alaris is a new and sneaky shellcode loader capable of bypassing most EDR systems as of today (10/14/2020). It uses several known TTP's that help protect the malware and it's execution flow. Some of these features are:

* Shellcode Encryption (AES-CBC 256)
* Direct x86 Syscalls (Does not use `NtDLL.dll`)
* Prevents 3rd party (non-Microsoft Signed) DLL's from hooking or injecting both the parent and child processes. 
* Parent Process ID spoofing
* Overwrites it's own shellcode after execution.
