Alaris is a new and sneaky shellcode loader capable of bypassing most EDR systems as of today (02/28/2021). It uses several known TTP's that help protect the malware and it's execution flow. Some of these features are:

* Shellcode Encryption (AES-CBC 256)
* Direct x86 Syscalls via https://twitter.com/Jackson_T[@Jackson T's] new https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2[SyWhispers2]
* Prevents 3rd party (non-Microsoft Signed) DLL's from hooking or injecting both the parent and child processes. 
* Parent Process ID spoofing
* Overwrites it's own shellcode after execution.

=== Updates

As on February 28th, 2021, several changes have been made:

. You can now easily build Alaris with the Python3 `builder.py` tool.
. Moved from https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers[SysWhispers] to https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2[SysWhispers2]

== Building Alaris

The easiest method to build Alaris is with `builder.py`. This is a python 3.6+ script that automates the following:

* Dynamic AES Key, IV generation that's unique for each build. Uses PBKDF2 to generate.
* AES Shellcode Encryption and Encoding from a raw binary shellcode file.
* Auto-Replacement of Shellcode, Key and IV within Alaris source. 
* Auto-Compiling of the Alaris source.
